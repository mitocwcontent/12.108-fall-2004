  resource reading, elasticity, anisotropic (single crystal) elasticity, linear elastic
  equations, symmetry causes further restrictions, stiffness moduli, elastic stiffness
  or compliance in an arbritrary direction, Relations among moduli, stiffnesses and
  compliances, some typical values of compressibility and Poisson?s ratio, and equivalent
  formulations for isotropic elastic materials in

  principal stress representation.'
